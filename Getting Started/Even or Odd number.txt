/**
 * Question Description:
 * This program checks whether a given integer is even or odd.

 * Input Format:
 * An integer entered by the user.

 * Output Format:
 * Prints "Even" if the number is divisible by 2, otherwise prints "Odd".

 * Approach:
 * - Read an integer input from the user.
 * - Use the modulo operator (%) to check if the number is divisible by 2.
 * - If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.
 * - Print the corresponding result.

 * Time Complexity: O(1) — Constant time as only a single arithmetic operation is performed.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) — Constant space usage.
