/**
 * Question Description:
 * Print the first N natural numbers in reverse order.
 * 
 * Input Format:
 * - A single integer N, which represents the number of natural numbers to print in reverse order.
 * 
 * Output Format:
 * - The natural numbers from N to 1, each printed on a new line.
 * 
 * Approach:
 * - Read the integer input N from the user.
 * - Use a for loop to iterate from N down to 1.
 * - Print each number during the iteration.
 * 
 * Time Complexity:
 * - The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the input number.
