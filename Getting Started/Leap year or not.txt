/**
 * Question Description:
 * This program checks whether a given year is a leap year or not based on the Gregorian calendar rules.

 * Input Format:
 * A single integer representing the year to be checked.

 * Output Format:
 * A message indicating whether the year is a leap year or not.

 * Approach:
 * - Read the year from the user.
 * - Apply the leap year rules:
 *   1. If the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.
 *   2. If the year is divisible by 100 (but not 400), it is not a leap year.
 *   3. If the year is divisible by 4 (but not 100), it is a leap year.
 *   4. Otherwise, it is not a leap year.
 * - Print the result accordingly.

 * Time Complexity: O(1) — Constant time as only a few arithmetic operations are performed.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) — Constant space usage.
