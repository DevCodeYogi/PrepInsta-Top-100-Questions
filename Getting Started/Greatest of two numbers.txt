/**
 * Question Description:
 * This program reads two integers from the user and determines which one is greater,
 * or if both are equal.

 * Input Format:
 * Two integers entered by the user.

 * Output Format:
 * A message indicating whether the numbers are equal, or which number is greater.

 * Approach:
 * - Read two integers from the user using a Scanner.
 * - Use conditional statements to compare the two numbers.
 * - Print the appropriate message based on the comparison result.

 * Time Complexity: O(1) â€” Only a single comparison is performed.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) â€” Constant space usage.
