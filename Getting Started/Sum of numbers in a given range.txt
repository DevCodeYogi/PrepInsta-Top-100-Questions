/**
 * Question Description:
 * This program calculates the sum of all integers within a given inclusive range [num1, num2].

 * Input Format:
 * Two integers entered by the user, representing the start and end of the range.

 * Output Format:
 * A single line displaying the sum of all integers in the specified range.

 * Approach:
 * - Read two integers from the user.
 * - Use a for-loop to iterate from the first number to the second number (inclusive).
 * - Accumulate the sum of all numbers in the range.
 * - Print the final result.

 * Time Complexity: O(n) — where n is the number of integers between num1 and num2 (inclusive).
 * Space Complexity: O(1) — constant space usage.
