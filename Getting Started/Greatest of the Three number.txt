/**
 * Question Description:
 * This program reads three integers from the user and determines the greatest among them.
 * If all three numbers are equal, it notifies the user accordingly.

 * Input Format:
 * Three integers entered by the user.

 * Output Format:
 * A message indicating the greatest number, or that all numbers are equal.

 * Approach:
 * - Read three integers from the user using a Scanner.
 * - First, check if all three numbers are equal.
 * - If not, use conditional statements to compare the numbers and determine the greatest.
 * - Print the result accordingly.

 * Time Complexity: O(1) â€” Constant time as only a fixed number of comparisons are made.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) â€” Constant space usage.
