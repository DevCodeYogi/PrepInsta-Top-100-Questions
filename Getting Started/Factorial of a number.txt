/**
 * Problem Description:
 * ---------------------
 * Write a program to calculate and print the factorial of a given positive integer.
 * The factorial of a number 'n' is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to 'n'.
 * For example, factorial of 5 (written as 5!) is 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.
 *
 * Input Format:
 * -------------
 * A single positive integer 'n' entered by the user.
 *
 * Output Format:
 * --------------
 * A single line displaying the factorial of the input number.
 *
 * Sample Input:
 * 5
 *
 * Sample Output:
 * Factorial value is : 120
 *
 * Approach:
 * ---------
 * - Initialize a variable `fact` to 1.
 * - Use a loop from 2 to `n`, multiplying `fact` by each number in the loop.
 * - Print the final value of `fact`.
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 * ----------------
 * O(n) — The loop runs 'n-1' times to compute the factorial.
 *
 * Space Complexity:
 * -----------------
 * O(1) — Constant space is used regardless of the input size.
